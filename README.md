# LingQ To Anki
A script that pulls up all LingQs from your LingQ account and adds them to Anki as flashcards.

# Using
Make sure Anki is running in the background and the AnkiConnect plugin is added(you can find it [here](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159)). Download [the latest release](https://github.com/squivix/LingQ-to-Anki/releases/latest), log in with your LingQ account, select the deck, and the model. Choose what to store in which fields and the program should take care of the rest.
